# SMRRT
## _SASS, Material, React, React-Router, Truffle_

SMRRT (pronounced "Smart") is a starter pack for using SASS, Material-UI, React, React-Router, and Truffle.

SMRRT is based on React Truffle Box found at https://github.com/truffle-box/react-box with a few tweaks. The default package includes support and examples for use of Material-UI, React-Router, Hooks, and SASS.

## Core differences
 - Upgrade for React/React-DOM to version 17.0.1
 - The example App is refactored to use React Hooks
 - Custom Material-UI boilerplate added
 - Simple implementation of React-Router
 - SASS example implementations including variables
 - React-Scripts upgrade and audit
